General Questions About Tables
1. What is a table in a database?
   A table is a collection of related data entries that consists of rows and columns. Each row represents a record, and each column represents a field within the record.
   Example:
   CREATE TABLE students (
       student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(100),
       age INT
   );

2. What are the different types of tables in a database?
   The types include:
   - Base tables: actual data storage.
   - Views: virtual tables based on queries.
   - Temporary tables: store data temporarily during a session.
   Example:
   CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_students AS SELECT * FROM students WHERE age > 18;

3. What is the difference between a fact table and a dimension table?
   A fact table stores quantitative data for analysis, while a dimension table contains descriptive attributes related to the facts.
   Example:
   Fact table: sales (transaction_id, amount, date).
   Dimension table: products (product_id, product_name, category).

4. How do you create a table in SQL?
   You use the CREATE TABLE statement followed by the table definition.
   Example:
   CREATE TABLE orders (
       order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
       order_date DATE,
       customer_id INT
   );

5. What are the different constraints that can be applied to a table?
   Constraints include:
   - PRIMARY KEY: unique identifier for a row.
   - FOREIGN KEY: links to another table.
   - UNIQUE: ensures all values in a column are different.
   Example:
   CREATE TABLE products (
       product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
       product_name VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
   );

6. What is the primary key of a table?
   The primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that no two rows have the same value.
   Example:
   student_id in the students table is a primary key.

7. What is a foreign key, and how is it used in a table?
   A foreign key is a column or set of columns in one table that references the primary key in another table, establishing a relationship.
   Example:
   CREATE TABLE orders (
       order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
       customer_id INT,
       FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
   );

8. What are composite keys, and when would you use them?
   Composite keys consist of two or more columns that together uniquely identify a record in a table. They are used when no single column can serve as a unique identifier.
   Example:
   CREATE TABLE enrollment (
       student_id INT,
       course_id INT,
       PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)
   );

9. How can you alter an existing table in SQL?
   You can use the ALTER TABLE statement to add, modify, or drop columns.
   Example:
   ALTER TABLE students ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(100);

10. What is a temporary table, and when is it used?
    A temporary table stores data temporarily during a session or transaction. It's used for intermediate calculations or data manipulation.
    Example:
    CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_sales AS SELECT * FROM sales WHERE sales_date = '2024-01-01';

Fact Tables
11. What is a fact table?
    A fact table is a central table in a star schema of a data warehouse that stores quantitative data for analysis.
    Example:
    CREATE TABLE sales_fact (
        sale_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        product_id INT,
        quantity_sold INT,
        sales_amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
    );

12. What are measures in a fact table?
    Measures are the numeric values that represent performance metrics or KPIs in a fact table.
    Example: 
    In the sales_fact table, quantity_sold and sales_amount are measures.

13. How do you determine the granularity of a fact table?
    Granularity refers to the level of detail stored in the fact table. It is determined by the business requirements.
    Example: 
    A sales_fact table with daily sales data has a finer granularity than one with monthly sales data.

14. Can a fact table contain NULL values? Why or why not?
    Yes, a fact table can contain NULL values, especially for measures that may not be applicable in certain scenarios.
    Example: 
    sales_amount can be NULL if the sale was canceled.

15. How do you aggregate data in a fact table?
    You can use SQL aggregate functions like SUM(), AVG(), COUNT() to aggregate data.
    Example:
    SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity_sold) FROM sales_fact GROUP BY product_id;

16. Explain how to design a fact table for a sales transaction.
    A sales fact table should include keys from dimension tables and measures relevant to sales.
    Example:
    CREATE TABLE sales_fact (
        sale_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        customer_id INT,
        product_id INT,
        sale_date DATE,
        quantity_sold INT,
        sales_amount DECIMAL(10, 2)
    );

17. What is the role of fact tables in data warehousing?
    Fact tables store quantitative data for reporting and analysis, facilitating decision-making processes.
    Example:
    Business analysts query the sales_fact table to analyze sales performance.

18. How can you optimize the performance of a fact table?
    You can optimize performance by indexing, partitioning, and using proper data types.
    Example:
    CREATE INDEX idx_product_id ON sales_fact(product_id);

19. What are some common measures stored in a sales fact table?
    Common measures include quantity sold, total sales amount, profit, and discount.
    Example:
    In the sales_fact table, you can have quantity_sold and total_revenue as measures.

20. How do you handle slowly changing dimensions with fact tables?
    You can implement different techniques like Type 1 (overwrite), Type 2 (history), and Type 3 (limited history) to manage changes.
    Example: 
    Use Type 2 for customer information to maintain historical records in the dimension table.

Dimension Tables
21. What is a dimension table?
    A dimension table contains descriptive attributes related to the facts, providing context to the quantitative data in the fact table.
    Example:
    CREATE TABLE products (
        product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        product_name VARCHAR(100),
        category VARCHAR(50)
    );

22. What are attributes in a dimension table?
    Attributes are the fields or columns in a dimension table that provide detailed information about the dimension.
    Example: 
    Attributes in the products table include product_name and category.

23. How do you design a dimension table for customer information?
    The table should include unique identifiers and relevant attributes about customers.
    Example:
    CREATE TABLE customers (
        customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(100),
        email VARCHAR(100),
        phone VARCHAR(15)
    );

24. What is the difference between a junk dimension and a degenerate dimension?
    A junk dimension contains miscellaneous attributes that do not fit into any other dimension, while a degenerate dimension consists of attributes that are primary keys in the fact table but do not have a separate dimension table.
    Example: 
    A junk dimension might include flags like 'promotional' or 'gift', while a degenerate dimension might include the order number.

25. How do you handle hierarchies in dimension tables?
    Hierarchies can be managed using additional attributes or separate tables to represent relationships.
    Example:
    In a products table, you might have category and subcategory attributes to represent hierarchy.

26. Can a dimension table have a composite key? Explain with an example.
    Yes, a dimension table can have a composite key, which consists of two or more columns.
    Example:
    CREATE TABLE product_sales (
        product_id INT,
        store_id INT,
        PRIMARY KEY (product_id, store_id)
    );

27. What is a role-playing dimension?
    A role-playing dimension is a dimension table that can be used multiple times in different contexts.
    Example:
    A date dimension can play different roles such as order date, ship date, and invoice date.

28. How do you maintain dimension tables in a data warehouse?
    Dimension tables should be updated regularly to reflect changes in attributes, and you can use techniques like ETL processes for this purpose.
    Example:
    Use scheduled ETL jobs to refresh dimension data from source systems.

29. How do you create a slowly changing dimension?
    You can create SCDs by defining how changes to dimension attributes should be tracked.
    Example:
    Implement Type 2 SCD to maintain historical data:
    CREATE TABLE customer_scd2 (
        customer_id INT,
        name VARCHAR(100),
        effective_date DATE,
        expiry_date DATE,
        is_current BOOLEAN
    );

30. What are some best practices for designing dimension tables?
    Best practices include ensuring unique identifiers, normalizing data, and keeping attribute names intuitive.
    Example:
    Ensure customer_id is unique in the customers table and use clear attribute names.

Normalization and Denormalization
31. What is normalization, and why is it important?
    Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.
    Example:
    Dividing a customer table into separate tables for contact information and billing details.

32. Explain the different normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF).
    - 1NF: Each column contains atomic values, and each record is unique.
    - 2NF: In 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.
    - 3NF: In 2NF and no transitive dependencies exist.
    - BCNF: A stronger version of 3NF; every determinant is a candidate key.
    Example:
    1NF: Customers table with unique rows, 2NF: Product orders with unique order IDs.

33. What are the advantages of normalization?
    Advantages include reduced data redundancy, improved data integrity, and easier data maintenance.
    Example:
    Normalized tables allow for less storage space and easier updates.

34. What is denormalization, and why would you use it?
    Denormalization is the process of combining normalized tables to improve read performance at the cost of increased redundancy.
    Example:
    Combining a customer table with order history for faster queries.

35. What are the trade-offs between normalization and denormalization?
    Normalization reduces redundancy but may slow down query performance; denormalization improves performance but increases data duplication.
    Example:
    Choose normalization for transactional systems and denormalization for reporting systems.

36. How do you identify redundant data in a table?
    You can identify redundancy by analyzing for repeated values across rows and columns.
    Example:
    Using SQL queries to find duplicate entries in the customers table.

37. When would you consider using denormalization in a data warehouse?
    Denormalization is considered when performance is prioritized for read-heavy queries, such as in data warehouses.
    Example:
    Combining fact and dimension tables for simplified reporting queries.

38. How do normalization and denormalization affect query performance?
    Normalization can lead to slower queries due to joins; denormalization can lead to faster queries but with potential data anomalies.
    Example:
    Queries on a normalized database may require multiple joins, slowing down performance.

39. What is a join, and how does it relate to normalized tables?
    A join combines rows from two or more tables based on related columns, often used in normalized databases.
    Example:
    SELECT customers.name, orders.order_id FROM customers INNER JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;

40. Explain the concept of data integrity in the context of normalization.
    Data integrity ensures that data is accurate and consistent, often enforced through normalization rules.
    Example:
    Using foreign keys to maintain integrity between related tables.

Types of Joins and Relationships
41. What are the different types of joins in SQL?
    Types of joins include:
    - INNER JOIN: returns matched records.
    - LEFT JOIN: returns all records from the left table.
    - RIGHT JOIN: returns all records from the right table.
    - FULL OUTER JOIN: returns all records from both tables.
    Example:
    SELECT * FROM students LEFT JOIN enrollments ON students.student_id = enrollments.student_id;

42. How do you perform an INNER JOIN between two tables?
    You use the INNER JOIN keyword to combine records from both tables based on a common field.
    Example:
    SELECT students.name, courses.course_name FROM students INNER JOIN enrollments ON students.student_id = enrollments.student_id INNER JOIN courses ON enrollments.course_id = courses.course_id;

43. What is an OUTER JOIN, and what types are there?
    An OUTER JOIN returns records that have matching values in one table and all records from one or both tables regardless of matches.
    Types include LEFT OUTER JOIN, RIGHT OUTER JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN.
    Example:
    SELECT * FROM students LEFT OUTER JOIN enrollments ON students.student_id = enrollments.student_id;

44. Explain how to use a CROSS JOIN in SQL.
    A CROSS JOIN produces a Cartesian product of two tables, combining every row from the first table with every row from the second.
    Example:
    SELECT * FROM students CROSS JOIN courses;

45. What is a self-join, and when would you use it?
    A self-join is a join of a table with itself to combine related records. It's used when a table has a hierarchical relationship.
    Example:
    SELECT a.name AS employee, b.name AS manager FROM employees a INNER JOIN employees b ON a.manager_id = b.employee_id;

46. How do you implement a many-to-many relationship using junction tables?
    You create a junction table that contains foreign keys referencing the primary keys of the two tables.
    Example:
    CREATE TABLE student_courses (
        student_id INT,
        course_id INT,
        PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)
    );

47. What are parent and child tables?
    A parent table is a table that is referenced by foreign keys in a child table, establishing a one-to-many relationship.
    Example:
    Customers (parent) and Orders (child) tables.

48. How does a left join differ from a right join?
    A left join returns all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table; a right join does the opposite.
    Example:
    SELECT * FROM employees LEFT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
    SELECT * FROM employees RIGHT JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;

49. Can you explain how to use subqueries to join tables?
    A subquery can be used in the WHERE clause of a main query to filter results based on conditions from another table.
    Example:
    SELECT name FROM students WHERE student_id IN (SELECT student_id FROM enrollments WHERE course_id = 101);

50. What is a composite relationship between tables?
    A composite relationship occurs when multiple foreign keys in a table refer to the primary keys of another table, often used in junction tables.
    Example:
    CREATE TABLE enrollment (
        student_id INT,
        course_id INT,
        PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id),
        FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id),
        FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(course_id)
    );

Advanced Table Concepts
51. What is a materialized view, and how does it differ from a regular view?
    A materialized view stores the result of a query physically, while a regular view does not store data and is recalculated each time it is accessed.
    Example:
    CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary AS SELECT product_id, SUM(sales_amount) FROM sales GROUP BY product_id;

52. How do you create a view based on multiple tables?
    You can use a SELECT statement that joins multiple tables to define a view.
    Example:
    CREATE VIEW customer_orders AS SELECT customers.name, orders.order_id FROM customers JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;

53. What is the purpose of indexes in a table?
    Indexes improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a table by providing quick access to rows.
    Example:
    CREATE INDEX idx_customer_name ON customers(name);

54. How can you create an index on a table, and what are its benefits?
    You can create an index using the CREATE INDEX statement to speed up query performance.
    Example:
    CREATE INDEX idx_order_date ON orders(order_date);

55. What is a clustered index vs. a non-clustered index?
    A clustered index determines the physical order of data in a table, while a non-clustered index creates a separate structure for the index.
    Example:
    CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX idx_customer_id ON customers(customer_id);
    CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX idx_order_id ON orders(order_id);

56. How do you use partitioning with large tables?
    Partitioning divides a large table into smaller, more manageable pieces based on specified criteria, improving performance and maintenance.
    Example:
    CREATE TABLE sales (
        sale_id INT,
        sale_date DATE,
        PARTITION BY RANGE (sale_date) (
            PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN ('2023-01-01'),
            PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN ('2024-01-01')
        )
    );

57. What are temporary tables, and how do they differ from regular tables?
    Temporary tables store data temporarily and are automatically dropped at the end of a session. Regular tables persist until explicitly deleted.
    Example:
    CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_orders AS SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date = '2024-01-01';

58. What is a table space in a database?
    A table space is a storage location in a database where physical data files are stored, allowing for data organization and management.
    Example:
    CREATE TABLESPACE my_tablespace DATAFILE 'my_datafile.dbf' SIZE 100M;

59. How do you manage schema changes in a production environment?
    Schema changes should be carefully planned and executed with proper version control and rollback strategies.
    Example:
    Use migration scripts to apply incremental schema changes.

60. What is the significance of the EXECUTE permission on table operations?
    The EXECUTE permission allows users to run stored procedures or functions that perform operations on tables, ensuring proper access control.
    Example:
    GRANT EXECUTE ON procedure_name TO user_name;

Performance and Optimization
61. How can you improve the performance of a large table?
    Performance can be improved through indexing, partitioning, and optimizing queries.
    Example:
    CREATE INDEX idx_large_table ON large_table(column_name);

62. What are some common performance issues with tables?
    Common issues include slow queries, table locks, and excessive I/O operations.
    Example:
    Analyzing execution plans can help identify slow queries.

63. How do you analyze the execution plan of a query involving multiple tables?
    You can use the EXPLAIN command to view the execution plan of a query.
    Example:
    EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM orders JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;

64. What is database indexing, and how does it improve performance?
    Database indexing creates a data structure that allows for faster searches and retrieval of records.
    Example:
    CREATE INDEX idx_product_name ON products(product_name);

65. How do you handle locking and concurrency issues in a multi-user environment?
    Locking mechanisms like row-level locking and transaction isolation levels can manage concurrency.
    Example:
    SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;

66. What are the implications of using large data types in table design?
    Large data types can consume significant storage and affect performance. They should be used judiciously.
    Example:
    Using VARCHAR instead of TEXT for shorter strings can improve performance.

67. How do you monitor the performance of a table?
    You can monitor performance by tracking query execution times and analyzing resource usage.
    Example:
    Using SQL Server Profiler or similar tools to monitor table access patterns.

68. What are some strategies for optimizing table joins?
    Optimizing joins can involve using indexes, reducing the number of columns in the SELECT clause, and filtering rows early.
    Example:
    SELECT customer_id, SUM(order_amount) FROM orders INNER JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id GROUP BY customer_id;

69. How does database design impact query performance?
    A well-designed database minimizes redundancy and optimizes indexing, leading to faster queries.
    Example:
    Properly indexed tables reduce search times in queries.

70. What are the best practices for managing table size?
    Best practices include archiving old data, partitioning large tables, and regularly monitoring table growth.
    Example:
    Implementing a data retention policy to archive records older than a specific date.

Data Warehousing Concepts
71. What is a star schema, and how does it relate to fact and dimension tables?
    A star schema is a type of database schema that organizes data into fact tables and dimension tables to facilitate querying.
    Example:
    A sales star schema might have a sales fact table and dimension tables for products, customers, and time.

72. Explain the snowflake schema and its advantages over the star schema.
    A snowflake schema normalizes dimension tables into multiple related tables, reducing redundancy and improving data integrity.
    Example:
    In a snowflake schema, a product dimension might be split into product categories and product details tables.

73. How do you choose between a star and a snowflake schema?
    Choosing depends on the specific use case: star for performance and simplicity, snowflake for normalization and integrity.
    Example:
    Use star schema for reporting and snowflake schema for complex analytical queries.

74. What is a factless fact table, and when is it used?
    A factless fact table records events without measures, often used to track many-to-many relationships.
    Example:
    A student enrollment table tracking students in courses without numeric measures.

75. What are slowly changing dimensions (SCD), and why are they important?
    Slowly changing dimensions track changes in dimension data over time, important for historical accuracy.
    Example:
    Storing customer address changes in a separate history table.

76. How do you implement a type 1 slowly changing dimension?
    In type 1, you overwrite existing data in the dimension table when changes occur.
    Example:
    UPDATE customers SET address = 'New Address' WHERE customer_id = 1;

77. How do you implement a type 2 slowly changing dimension?
    In type 2, you add a new record for each change, preserving historical data.
    Example:
    INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, address, effective_date) VALUES (1, 'New Address', '2024-01-01');

78. What is a bridge table, and when would you use one?
    A bridge table resolves many-to-many relationships by connecting two dimension tables.
    Example:
    A bridge table linking students and courses in an enrollment scenario.

79. How do you handle historical data in dimension tables?
    Historical data is managed through SCD methods or separate history tables to preserve past states.
    Example:
    Using a separate dimension table for historical addresses.

80. What are aggregate tables, and how are they used?
    Aggregate tables store pre-computed summaries of data, improving query performance for large datasets.
    Example:
    A sales aggregate table summarizing total sales by month.

Real-world Scenarios
81. Describe a situation where you had to redesign a table structure.
    Redesigning occurred when new business requirements emerged, necessitating changes in relationships between tables.
    Example:
    Consolidating customer information from multiple tables into a single customer table.

82. How do you handle changes in business requirements that affect table design?
    Changes are managed by analyzing impacts on existing tables and modifying structures as needed.
    Example:
    Updating the order table to include a new field for shipping information.

83. Describe a scenario where normalization caused performance issues.
    A highly normalized database experienced slow query performance due to excessive joins, requiring a denormalization approach.
    Example:
    Combining several normalized tables into fewer, larger tables for reporting purposes.

84. What is your approach to migrating data from legacy tables to new structures?
    Data migration is done using ETL processes to extract, transform, and load data into new table structures.
    Example:
    Using Python scripts to read data from legacy databases and insert it into the new schema.

85. How do you ensure data quality in tables?
    Data quality is ensured through validation rules, constraints, and regular audits of table contents.
    Example:
    Implementing CHECK constraints to enforce valid data entry.

86. Can you explain a situation where you used a composite key?
    A composite key was used to uniquely identify records in a junction table connecting students and courses.
    Example:
    student_courses table with student_id and course_id as a composite primary key.

87. How do you document table designs and relationships?
    Documentation includes ER diagrams, data dictionaries, and version-controlled schema definitions.
    Example:
    Using Lucidchart to create ER diagrams for visual representation of table relationships.

88. Describe how you would approach a data modeling project.
    I would start by gathering requirements, followed by creating logical and physical models, and iterating based on feedback.
    Example:
    Developing a data model for a new CRM system by analyzing user needs and iterating on designs.

90. How do you handle error logging and debugging with tables?
    Error logging is implemented using audit tables or logging mechanisms in application code to capture issues.
    Example:
    Creating an audit table to track changes and errors in the orders table.

Data Manipulation and Queries
91. How do you insert data into a table in SQL?
    You can use the INSERT statement to add new records to a table.
    Example:
    INSERT INTO customers (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com');

92. What are the different ways to update records in a table?
    Records can be updated using the UPDATE statement with SET to modify specific fields.
    Example:
    UPDATE customers SET email = 'john.doe@example.com' WHERE customer_id = 1;

93. How do you delete records from a table safely?
    Records can be deleted using the DELETE statement, ensuring conditions to avoid accidental data loss.
    Example:
    DELETE FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 1;

94. How do you use the SELECT statement to retrieve data from multiple tables?
    You can use JOIN clauses within the SELECT statement to combine data from multiple tables.
    Example:
    SELECT customers.name, orders.order_id FROM customers JOIN orders ON customers.customer_id = orders.customer_id;

95. What is the purpose of the GROUP BY clause in SQL?
    The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns.
    Example:
    SELECT product_id, SUM(sales) FROM sales GROUP BY product_id;

96. How do you use the HAVING clause in conjunction with GROUP BY?
    The HAVING clause filters groups based on a specified condition after aggregation.
    Example:
    SELECT product_id, SUM(sales) FROM sales GROUP BY product_id HAVING SUM(sales) > 1000;

97. How can you use window functions to analyze data in a table?
    Window functions perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row, without collapsing results.
    Example:
    SELECT name, AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id) AS avg_salary FROM employees;

98. What are aggregate functions, and how do they relate to tables?
    Aggregate functions perform calculations on multiple rows of a table and return a single value.
    Example:
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;

99. How do you implement pagination in query results from a table?
    Pagination is implemented using LIMIT and OFFSET in SQL queries.
    Example:
    SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY order_date LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;

100. What is the DISTINCT keyword, and how is it used with tables?
    The DISTINCT keyword filters out duplicate rows in the result set of a query.
    Example:
    SELECT DISTINCT city FROM customers;

Data Integrity and Constraints
101. What are the different types of constraints in SQL?
    Types of constraints include PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK, and DEFAULT.
    Example:
    PRIMARY KEY (customer_id), FOREIGN KEY (order_id REFERENCES orders(order_id)).

102. How do you implement referential integrity between tables?
    Referential integrity is enforced by using FOREIGN KEY constraints to maintain relationships between tables.
    Example:
    CREATE TABLE orders (
        order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
        customer_id INT,
        FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
    );

103. What is a check constraint, and how is it used?
    A CHECK constraint limits the values that can be inserted into a column.
    Example:
    CREATE TABLE employees (salary DECIMAL CHECK (salary > 0));

104. How do you handle data validation when inserting records into a table?
    Data validation can be implemented using constraints and application-level checks before inserting records.
    Example:
    Ensuring email format using a regex check before inserting into the customers table.

105. What are the implications of using ON DELETE CASCADE in a foreign key constraint?
    ON DELETE CASCADE automatically deletes records in the child table when the corresponding record in the parent table is deleted.
    Example:
    DELETE FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 1; // Deletes associated orders if ON DELETE CASCADE is set.

106. How do you prevent duplicate records in a table?
    Preventing duplicates can be achieved using UNIQUE constraints and application logic.
    Example:
    CREATE TABLE products (product_id INT UNIQUE, product_name VARCHAR(255));

107. What is the purpose of an index in a table?
    An index improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table at the cost of additional space.
    Example:
    CREATE INDEX idx_customer_name ON customers(name);

108. How do you create a composite index, and when would you use one?
    A composite index is created on multiple columns to optimize queries that filter on those columns.
    Example:
    CREATE INDEX idx_full_name ON employees(first_name, last_name);

109. How do you manage index fragmentation in a database?
    Index fragmentation can be managed through regular maintenance tasks like rebuilding or reorganizing indexes.
    Example:
    EXEC sp_rebuild_index 'my_index', 'my_table';
