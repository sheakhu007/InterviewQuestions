        Create Glue Crawlers to infer schema from data in S3.
        Use Glue jobs to clean and transform the data.
        Store the processed data back in S3 or load it into Redshift for analysis.

    What are the differences between Redshift, RDS, and DynamoDB?
        Redshift: Data warehouse for OLAP (analytics).
        RDS: Relational database for OLTP (transactions), supports multiple engines (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).

        Data lake stores raw data in its native format; a data warehouse stores structured, processed data.
        Data lakes are optimized for flexibility and scalability; data warehouses are optimized for performance on structured data.
        Data lakes use object storage (e.g., S3), while data warehouses use columnar storage (e.g., Redshift).

    How does Amazon Athena query data in S3?
        Athena uses a schema-on-read model, where data is read and interpreted only when queried.
